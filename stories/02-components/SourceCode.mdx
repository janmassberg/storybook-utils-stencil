# SourceCode

The `SourceCode` component can be used in a MDX story to group code snippets and provide a tab navigation to only show
code that is relevant for the user.

### Default

By default, code is displayed on a `dark` background.

<Canvas of={SourceCodeStories.Default} />

### Light Theme

Set `theme` to `light` if you prefer a light background for the code.

<Canvas of={SourceCodeStories.LightTheme} />

### Multiple Blocks

A codeBlock entry can have multiple code fragments.
Optionally, a title can be passed in which can describe the code snippet.

<Canvas of={SourceCodeStories.MultipleBlock} />

## Multiple Tabs

Data and structure are provided in the `codeBlocks` property.

For each `codeBlocks` entry a tab is added to the tab navigation.
The tabs are labelled with the key of the related entry.

Set the `language` attribute on the code blocks to the language the code is written in.
The language is used for code formatting and to display an info badge.
